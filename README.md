# SimulatorExecutables
ECE 270 executables to run the simulator locally

This is for Windows machines ONLY.  If there is a need for a Mac tutorial, I will make one.
Your Windows machine must be at least at Windows 7 and have virtualization enabled.  The process to determine if your machine is capable of virtualization and has virtualization enabled can be found at: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/

Run the installation executable to download and install Docker Toolbox.
Run Simulator.exe to run the simulator.  If this is your first time running the simulator, it will take a little time for the VM to pull the latest image.  Wait until the console prompts you to access "localhost:2100" before trying to access the simulator.  It will not be hosted at localhost:2100, but at the IP that is specified in the console (usually in the form of 192.168.99.10x).
