# SimulatorExecutables
ECE 270 executables to run the simulator locally

Run the installation executable to download and install Docker Toolbox.
Run Simulator.exe to run the simulator.  If this is your first time running the simulator, it will take a little time for the VM to pull the latest image.  Wait until the console prompts you to access "localhost:2100" before trying to access the simulator.  It will not be hosted at localhost:2100, but at the IP that is specified in the console (usually in the form of 192.168.99.10x).
